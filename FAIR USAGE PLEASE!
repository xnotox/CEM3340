I offer these files for free usage. One is allowed to use them to manufacture own boards in limited quantity. Nevertheless I've worked quite alot for it, and therefore donations are welcome. Further it is allowed to alter or modify the design, but please reference the initial source. It is not allowed to manufacture these boards in quantities and sell it without my permission.

I hope this is used in a fair way.

Thx
