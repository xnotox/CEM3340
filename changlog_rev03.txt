GOAL
-IMPROVE PWM CONTROL PERFORMANCE				(1)
-REVISE ERRORS AND INCREASE PRECISION				(2)
-OPEN THE BOARD UP FOR ALL KIND OF EXPERIMENTS AND EXPANSIONS	(3)


CHANGELOG

- NEW STRUCTURED SIGNAL FLOW AND ROUTING!!!
- INCREASED BOARD SIZE TO 108x60
- ADDED PROPER MOUNTING HOLES
- CORRECTED SOME RESISTOR VALUES (LM4040 	10k --> 1k,3340 PIN3 910R --> 620R)
- BYPASS 1.8k ON PIN14 TO GROUND
- ADDED OCTAVE SWITCH WITH HEADER FOR PANEL SWITCH
- ADDED XP1 HEADER WITH +12 -12 +5 CVIN SYNC_IN SINE_OUT FOR EXPERIMENTS AND FIXES
- CHANGED PWM CONTROL CIRCUIT TO TRIMMABLE MORE PRECISE VERSION
- ADDED XP2 HEADER WITH 2ND OUTPUT OF BUFFERD WAVEFORMS


FUTURE
- A CMOS OR CPLD BASED SYNC BACKPACK WHICH WILL ENABLE HARD AND SOFT SYNC ON ALL EDGES AND COMBINATIONS
- A CMOS OR CPLD BASED TUNER BACKBACK WICH WILL GIVE YOU VISUAL FEEDBACK OF THE OUTPUT FREQUENCY
