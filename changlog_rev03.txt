GOAL
-IMPROVE PWM CONTROL PERFORMANCE				(1)
-REVISE ERRORS AND INCREASE PRECISION				(2)
-OPEN THE BOARD UP FOR ALL KIND OF EXPERIMENTS AND EXPANSIONS	(3)


CHANGELOG

- NEW STRUCTURED SIGNAL FLOW AND ROUTING!!!
- INCREASED BOARD SIZE TO 100x62
- CORRECTED SOME RESISTOR VALUES (LM4040 10k --> 1k,3340 PIN3 910R --> 620R)
- BYPASS 1.8k ON PIN14 TO GROUND
- ADDED OCTAVE SWITCH WITH HEADER FOR PANEL SWITCH
- ADDED XP1 HEADER WITH EXTERNAL/BREAKOUTS PITCH SAW SSYNC HS+ HS- LFM FOR EXPERIMENTS AND FIXES
- CHANGED PWM CONTROL CIRCUIT TO TRIMMABLE MORE PRECISE VERSION
- ADDED XP2 HEADER WITH 2ND OUTPUT OF BUFFERD WAVEFORMS
- ADDED MULTIFUNCTIONAL FOOTPRINT TO INSTALL EITHER 2N3904 OR LM394(obsolete) OR THAT300(expensive only half used) AS DIFFERENTIAL PAIR IN THE SINESHAPER
- REDUCED LIN FM RES TO 470k AND ADDED SUMMING OPAMP FOR EXPANSIONS. ACTS AS VIRTUAL GROUND
TODO
- RESISTOR VALUES OF THE OUTPUT BUFFER NEED RECALCULATION


THRU ZERO EXPANSION BOARD

- EXPERIMENTAL STAGE WORKS ON BREADBOARD USING CMOS4000
- SWITCHED TO 74HC FOR SPEED 
- ADDED SWITCH TO CHOOSE THRU ZERO OR HS+-

FUTURE PLANS FOR OPENCEM3340
- A CMOS OR CPLD BASED TUNER BACKBACK WICH WILL GIVE YOU VISUAL FEEDBACK OF THE OUTPUT FREQUENCY
